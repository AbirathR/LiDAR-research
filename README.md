As a part of the LIDAR research group at Georgia Tech, advised by Dr. Ye Zhao, I am working on the computer vision capabilities of a humanoid robot(Digit). 
I am working on helping Digit navigate through an environment with humans and avoid collisions. 
My work involves creating DL models for perception that take in Lidar data as input and output markers of humans detected in the vicinity.
I am also working on a MoCap system with the help of Vicon MoCap system to get the positions of humans in the vicinity of Digit by attaching markers on humans.
